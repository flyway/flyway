# Implement Plan

You are tasked with implementing an approved technical plan from `<working-directory>/implementation.md`. This plan contain phases with specific changes and success criteria.

## Getting Started

When given a plan path:
- Read the plan completely and check for any existing checkmarks (- [x])
- Read all files mentioned in the plan
- **Read files fully** - never use limit/offset parameters, you need complete context
- Think deeply about how the pieces fit together
- Create a todo list to track your progress
- Start implementing if you understand what needs to be done

## Implementation Philosophy

Plans are carefully designed, but reality can be messy. Your job is to:
- Follow the plan's intent while adapting to what you find
- Implement each phase fully before moving to the next
- Verify your work makes sense in the broader codebase context
- Update checkboxes in the plan as you complete sections
- Commit to git or stop to allow the user to commit at regular intervals
  - Commits should tell a sensible story, while being as small as possible

When things don't match the plan exactly, think about why and communicate clearly. The plan is your guide, but your judgment matters too.

If you encounter a mismatch:
- STOP and think deeply about why the plan can't be followed
- Present the issue clearly:
  ```
  Issue in Phase [N]:
  Expected: [what the plan says]
  Found: [actual situation]
  Why this matters: [explanation]

  How should I proceed?
  ```

- The user may opt to return to an earlier stage of generating the implementation plan or provide new details to you. 
  - The Mikado method might be suitable here - going back to the start and doing a different piece of work first.
  - You could write the prompt needed to trigger a new Research phrase. 
  - Guidance is available in `.llm/prompts/README`.

## Verification Approach

After implementing a phase:
- Run the success criteria checks
- Fix any issues before proceeding
- Update your progress in both the plan and your todos
- Check off completed items in the plan file itself using Edit

Don't let verification interrupt your flow - batch it at natural stopping points.

## If You Get Stuck

When something isn't working as expected:
- First, make sure you've read and understood all the relevant code
- Consider if the codebase has evolved since the plan was written
- Present the mismatch clearly and ask for guidance

## Resuming Work

If the plan has existing checkmarks:
- Trust that completed work is done
- Pick up from the first unchecked item
- Verify previous work only if something seems off

Remember: You're implementing a solution, not just checking boxes. Keep the end goal in mind and maintain forward momentum.
