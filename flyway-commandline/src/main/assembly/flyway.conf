# Password to use to connect to the database. Flyway will prompt you to enter it if not specified.
# flyway.password=

# The maximum number of retries when attempting to connect to the database. After each failed attempt,
# Flyway will wait 1 second before attempting to connect again, up to the maximum number of times specified
# by connectRetries. (default: 0)
# flyway.connectRetries=

# The SQL statements to run to initialize a new database connection immediately after opening it. (default: none)
# flyway.initSql=

# Comma-separated list of schemas managed by Flyway. These schema names are case-sensitive.
# (default: The default schema for the datasource connection)
# Consequences:
# - The first schema in the list will be automatically set as the default one during the migration.
# - The first schema in the list will also be the one containing the schema history table.
# - The schemas will be cleaned in the order of this list.
# flyway.schemas=

# Name of Flyway's schema history table (default: flyway_schema_history)
# By default (single-schema mode) the schema history table is placed in the default schema for the connection
# provided by the datasource.
# When the flyway.schemas property is set (multi-schema mode), the schema history table is placed in the first
# schema of the list.
# flyway.table=

# Comma-separated list of locations to scan recursively for migrations. (default: filesystem:<<INSTALL-DIR>>/sql)
# The location type is determined by its prefix.
# Unprefixed locations or locations starting with classpath: point to a package on the classpath and may contain
# both SQL and Java-based migrations.
# Locations starting with filesystem: point to a directory on the filesystem, may only
# contain SQL migrations and are only scanned recursively down non-hidden directories.
# flyway.locations=

# Comma-separated list of fully qualified class names of custom MigrationResolver to use for resolving migrations.
# flyway.resolvers=

# If set to true, default built-in resolvers (jdbc, spring-jdbc and sql) are skipped and only custom resolvers as

# Comma-separated list of directories containing JDBC drivers and Java-based migrations.
# (default: <INSTALL-DIR>/jars)
# flyway.jarDirs=

# File name prefix for versioned SQL migrations (default: V)
# Versioned SQL migrations have the following file name structure: prefixVERSIONseparatorDESCRIPTIONsuffix ,
# which using the defaults translates to V1_1__My_description.sql
# flyway.sqlMigrationPrefix=

# The file name prefix for undo SQL migrations. (default: U)

# Whether to stream SQL migrations when executing them. (default: false)
# Streaming doesn't load the entire migration in memory at once. Instead each statement is loaded individually.
# This is particularly useful for very large SQL migrations composed of multiple MB or even GB of reference data,
# as this dramatically reduces Flyway's memory consumption.
# Flyway Pro and Flyway Enterprise only
# flyway.stream=

# Whether to batch SQL statements when executing them. (default: false)
# Batching can save up to 99 percent of network roundtrips by sending up to 100 statements at once over the
# network to the database, instead of sending each statement individually. This is particularly useful for very
# large SQL migrations composed of multiple MB or even GB of reference data, as this can dramatically reduce
# the network overhead. This is supported for INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, MERGE and UPSERT statements.
# All other statements are automatically executed without batching.
# Flyway Pro and Flyway Enterprise only

# Whether to automatically call validate or not when running migrate. (default: true)
# flyway.validateOnMigrate=

# Whether to automatically call clean or not when a validation error occurs. (default: false)
# This is exclusively intended as a convenience for development. Even tough we
# strongly recommend not to change migration scripts once they have been checked into SCM and run, this provides a
# way of dealing with this case in a smooth manner. The database will be wiped clean automatically, ensuring that
# the next migration will bring you back to the state checked into SCM.
# Warning ! Do not enable in production !
# flyway.cleanOnValidationError=

# Whether to disabled clean. (default: false)
# This is especially useful for production environments where running clean can be quite a career limiting move.
# flyway.cleanDisabled=

# The version to tag an existing schema with when executing baseline. (default: 1)
# flyway.baselineVersion=

# The description to tag an existing schema with when executing baseline. (default: << Flyway Baseline >>)
# flyway.baselineDescription=

# Whether to automatically call baseline when migrate is executed against a non-empty schema with no schema history
# table. This schema will then be initialized with the baselineVersion before executing the migrations.
# Only migrations above baselineVersion will then be applied.
# This is useful for initial Flyway production deployments on projects with an existing DB.
# Be careful when enabling this as it removes the safety net that ensures
# Flyway does not migrate the wrong database in case of a configuration mistake! (default: false)
# flyway.baselineOnMigrate=

# Allows migrations to be run "out of order" (default: false).
# If you already have versions 1 and 3 applied, and now a version 2 is found,
# it will be applied too instead of being ignored.
# flyway.outOfOrder=

# This allows you to tie in custom code and logic to the Flyway lifecycle notifications (default: empty).

# Ignore missing migrations when reading the schema history table. These are migrations that were performed by an
# older deployment of the application that are no longer available in this version. For example: we have migrations
# available on the classpath with versions 1.0 and 3.0. The schema history table indicates that a migration with
# version 2.0 (unknown to us) has also been applied. Instead of bombing out (fail fast) with an exception, a
# warning is logged and Flyway continues normally. This is useful for situations where one must be able to deploy
# a newer version of the application even though it doesn't contain migrations included with an older one anymore.
# Note that if the most recently applied migration is removed, Flyway has no way to know it is missing and will
# mark it as future instead.
# true to continue normally and log a warning, false to fail fast with an exception. (default: false)
# flyway.ignoreMissingMigrations=

# Ignore ignored migrations when reading the schema history table. These are migrations that were added in between
# already migrated migrations in this version. For example: we have migrations available on the classpath with
# versions from 1.0 to 3.0. The schema history table indicates that version 1 was finished on 1.0.15, and the next
# one was 2.0.0. But with the next release a new migration was added to version 1: 1.0.16. Such scenario is ignored
# by migrate command, but by default is rejected by validate. When ignoreIgnoredMigrations is enabled, such case
# will not be reported by validate command. This is useful for situations where one must be able to deliver
# complete set of migrations in a delivery package for multiple versions of the product, and allows for further
# development of older versions.
# true to continue normally, false to fail fast with an exception. (default: false)
# flyway.ignoreIgnoredMigrations=

# Ignore pending migrations when reading the schema history table. These are migrations that are available
# but have not yet been applied. This can be useful for verifying that in-development migration changes
# don't contain any validation-breaking changes of migrations that have already been applied to a production
# environment, e.g. as part of a CI/CD process, without failing because of the existence of new migration versions.
# (default: false)
# flyway.ignorePendingMigrations=

# Ignore future migrations when reading the schema history table. These are migrations that were performed by a
# newer deployment of the application that are not yet available in this version. For example: we have migrations
# available on the classpath up to version 3.0. The schema history table indicates that a migration to version 4.0
# (unknown to us) has already been applied. Instead of bombing out (fail fast) with an exception, a
# warning is logged and Flyway continues normally. This is useful for situations where one must be able to redeploy
# an older version of the application after the database has been migrated by a newer one.
# true to continue normally and log a warning, false to fail fast with an exception. (default: true)
# flyway.ignoreFutureMigrations=

# Whether to allow mixing transactional and non-transactional statements within the same migration.
# true if mixed migrations should be allowed. false if an error should be thrown instead. (default: false)
# flyway.mixed=

# Whether to group all pending migrations together in the same transaction when applying them
# (only recommended for databases with support for DDL transactions).
# true if migrations should be grouped. false if they should be applied individually instead. (default: false)
# flyway.group=

# The username that will be recorded in the schema history table as having applied the migration.
# <<blank>> for the current database user of the connection. (default: <<blank>>).
# flyway.installedBy=

# Rules for the built-in error handling that lets you override specific SQL states and errors codes from error to
# warning or from warning to error.
# Each error override has the following format: STATE:12345:W. It is a 5 character SQL state, a colon, the SQL
# error code, a colon and finally the desired behavior that should override the initial one. The following
# behaviors are accepted: W to force a warning and E to force an error.
# For example, to force Oracle stored procedure compilation issues to produce errors instead of warnings,
# the following errorOverride can be used: 99999:17110:E
# Flyway Pro and Flyway Enterprise only
# flyway.errorOverrides=

# The file where to output the SQL statements of a migration dry run. If the file specified is in a non-existent
# directory, Flyway will create all directories and parent directories as needed.
# <<blank>> to execute the SQL statements directly against the database. (default: <<blank>>)
