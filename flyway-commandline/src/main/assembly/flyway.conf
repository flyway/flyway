# connection is not using a password-less method of authentication.
# flyway.password=

# The maximum number of retries when attempting to connect to the database. After each failed attempt,

# (default: 0)
# flyway.connectRetries=

# The maximum time between retries when attempting to connect to the database in seconds.

# flyway.initSql=

# The default schema managed by Flyway. This schema name is case-sensitive. If not specified, but flyway.schemas
# is, Flyway uses the first schema in that list. If that is also not specified, Flyway uses the default schema for the
# database connection.
# Consequences:
# - This schema will be the one containing the schema history table.
# - This schema will be the default for the database connection (provided the database supports this concept).
# flyway.defaultSchema=

# Comma-separated list of the schemas managed by Flyway. These schema names are case-sensitive. If not specified, Flyway uses
# the default schema for the database connection. If flyway.defaultSchema is not specified, then the first of
# this list also acts as the default schema.
# Consequences:
# - Flyway will automatically attempt to create all these schemas, unless they already exist.
# - The schemas will be cleaned in the order of this list.
# - If Flyway created them, the schemas themselves will be dropped when cleaning.
# flyway.schemas=

# Whether Flyway should attempt to create the schemas specified in the flyway.schemas property
# flyway.createSchemas=

# The name of Flyway's schema history table (default: flyway_schema_history)

# or in the schema specified to flyway.defaultSchema.
# flyway.table=

# The tablespace where to create the schema history table that will be used by Flyway. If not specified, Flyway uses

# Comma-separated list of locations to scan recursively for migrations. (default: filesystem:<<INSTALL-DIR>>/sql)
# The location type is determined by its prefix.
# Unprefixed locations or locations starting with classpath: point to a package on the classpath and may contain
# both SQL and Java-based migrations.
#
# Locations starting with filesystem: point to a directory on the filesystem, may only
# contain SQL migrations and are only scanned recursively down non-hidden directories.
# Locations starting with s3: point to a bucket in AWS S3, may only contain SQL migrations, and are scanned
# recursively. They are in the format s3:<bucket>(/optionalfolder/subfolder)
# Locations starting with gcs: point to a bucket in Google Cloud Storage, may only contain SQL migrations, and are scanned
# recursively. They are in the format gcs:<bucket>(/optionalfolder/subfolder)
# Wildcards can be used to reduce duplication of location paths. (e.g. filesystem:migrations/*/oracle) Supported wildcards:

# auto: Auto detect the logger (default behavior)
# console: Use stdout/stderr (only available when using the CLI)
# slf4j: Use the slf4j logger
# log4j2: Use the log4j2 logger
# apache-commons: Use the Apache Commons logger
#
# Alternatively you can provide the fully qualified class name for any other logger to use that.

# editors with specific file associations.
# flyway.sqlMigrationSuffixes=

# Whether to stream SQL migrations when executing them. (default: false)
# Streaming doesn't load the entire migration in memory at once. Instead each statement is loaded individually.
# This is particularly useful for very large SQL migrations composed of multiple MB or even GB of reference data,
# as this dramatically reduces Flyway's memory consumption.
# Flyway Teams only
# flyway.stream=

# Whether to batch SQL statements when executing them. (default: false)
# Batching can save up to 99 percent of network roundtrips by sending up to 100 statements at once over the
# network to the database, instead of sending each statement individually. This is particularly useful for very
# large SQL migrations composed of multiple MB or even GB of reference data, as this can dramatically reduce
# the network overhead. This is supported for INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, MERGE and UPSERT statements.
# All other statements are automatically executed without batching.
# Flyway Teams only
# flyway.batch=

# Whether SQL should be executed in a transaction (default: true).

# Special values:
# - 'current': designates the current version of the schema
# - 'latest': the latest version of the schema, as defined by the migration with the highest version
# - 'next': the next version of the schema, as defined by the first pending migration
# - '<version>?' (end with a '?'): Instructs Flyway not to fail if the target version doesn't exist.
#                                  In this case, Flyway will go up to but not beyond the specified target

# Flyway Teams only
# flyway.cherryPick=

# Whether to automatically call validate or not when running migrate. (default: true)
# flyway.validateOnMigrate=

# Whether to automatically call clean or not when a validation error occurs. (default: false)
# This is exclusively intended as a convenience for development. even though we
# strongly recommend not to change migration scripts once they have been checked into SCM and run, this provides a
# way of dealing with this case in a smooth manner. The database will be wiped clean automatically, ensuring that
# the next migration will bring you back to the state checked into SCM.
# Warning! Do not enable in production!
# flyway.cleanOnValidationError=

# Whether to disable clean. (default: true)
# Set to false if you need to be able to clean your environment (can be a career limiting move)
# flyway.cleanDisabled=

# The version to tag an existing schema with when executing baseline. (default: 1)
# flyway.baselineVersion=

# The description to tag an existing schema with when executing baseline. (default: << Flyway Baseline >>)
# flyway.baselineDescription=

# Whether to automatically call baseline when migrate is executed against a non-empty schema with no schema history
# table. This schema will then be initialized with the baselineVersion before executing the migrations.
# Only migrations above baselineVersion will then be applied.
# This is useful for initial Flyway production deployments on projects with an existing DB.
# Be careful when enabling this as it removes the safety net that ensures
# Flyway does not migrate the wrong database in case of a configuration mistake! (default: false)
# flyway.baselineOnMigrate=

# Whether Flyway should skip actually executing the contents of the migrations and only update the schema history table. (default: false)
# This should be used when you have applied a migration manually (via executing the sql yourself, or via an IDE), and
# just want the schema history table to reflect this.
#
# Use in conjunction with flyway.cherryPick to skip specific migrations instead of all pending ones.
# Flyway Teams only
# flyway.skipExecutingMigrations=

# Allows migrations to be run "out of order" (default: false).
# If you already have versions 1 and 3 applied, and now a version 2 is found,
# it will be applied too instead of being ignored.
# flyway.outOfOrder=

# Whether Flyway should output a table with the results of queries when executing migrations (default: true).
# Flyway Teams only
# flyway.outputQueryResults=

# This allows you to tie in custom code and logic to the Flyway lifecycle notifications (default: empty).
# Set this to a comma-separated list of fully qualified class names of org.flywaydb.core.api.callback.Callback implementations, or packages to scan for these classes.
# flyway.callbacks=

# If set to true, default built-in callbacks (SQL) are skipped and only custom callback as
# defined by 'flyway.callbacks' are used. (default: false)
# flyway.skipDefaultCallbacks=

# Ignore migrations that match this comma-separated list of patterns when validating migrations.
# Each pattern is of the form <migration_type>:<migration_state>
# See https://documentation.red-gate.com/fd/ignore-migration-patterns-184127507.html for full details
# Example: repeatable:missing,versioned:pending,*:failed
# (default: *:future)
# flyway.ignoreMigrationPatterns=

# Whether to validate migrations and callbacks whose scripts do not obey the correct naming convention. A failure can be
# useful to check that errors such as case sensitivity in migration prefixes have been corrected.
# false to continue normally, true to fail fast with an exception (default: false)
# flyway.validateMigrationNaming=

# Whether to allow mixing transactional and non-transactional statements within the same migration.
# Flyway attempts to run each migration within its own transaction
# If Flyway detects that a specific statement cannot be run within a transaction, it won’t run that migration within a transaction
# This option toggles whether transactional and non-transactional statements can be mixed within a migration run.
# Enabling this means for 'mixed' migrations, the entire script will be run without a transaction
# Note that this is only applicable for PostgreSQL, Aurora PostgreSQL, SQL Server and SQLite which all have
# statements that do not run at all within a transaction.
# This is not to be confused with implicit transaction, as they occur in MySQL or Oracle, where even though a
# DDL statement was run within within a transaction, the database will issue an implicit commit before and after
# its execution.
# true if mixed migrations should be allowed. false if an error should be thrown instead. (default: false)
# flyway.mixed=

# Whether to group all pending migrations together in the same transaction when applying them
# (only recommended for databases with support for DDL transactions).
# true if migrations should be grouped. false if they should be applied individually instead. (default: false)
# flyway.group=

# The username that will be recorded in the schema history table as having applied the migration.
# <<blank>> for the current database user of the connection. (default: <<blank>>).
# flyway.installedBy=

# Rules for the built-in error handler that let you override specific SQL states and errors codes in order to
# force specific errors or warnings to be treated as debug messages, info messages, warnings or errors.
# Each error override has the following format: STATE:12345:W.
# It is a 5 character SQL state (or * to match all SQL states), a colon,
# the SQL error code (or * to match all SQL error codes), a colon, and finally
# the desired behavior that should override the initial one.
# The following behaviors are accepted:
# - D  to force a debug message
# - D- to force a debug message, but do not show the original sql state and error code
# - I  to force an info message
# - I- to force an info message, but do not show the original sql state and error code
# - W  to force a warning
# - W- to force a warning, but do not show the original sql state and error code
# - E  to force an error
# - E- to force an error, but do not show the original sql state and error code
# Example 1: to force Oracle stored procedure compilation issues to produce
# errors instead of warnings, the following errorOverride can be used: 99999:17110:E
# Example 2: to force SQL Server PRINT messages to be displayed as info messages (without SQL state and error
# code details) instead of warnings, the following errorOverride can be used: S0001:0:I-
# Example 3: to force all errors with SQL error code 123 to be treated as warnings instead,
# the following errorOverride can be used: *:123:W
# Flyway Teams only
# flyway.errorOverrides=

# The file where to output the SQL statements of a migration dry run. If the file specified is in a non-existent

# Paths starting with s3: point to a bucket in AWS S3, which must exist. They are in the format s3:<bucket>(/optionalfolder/subfolder)/filename.sql
# Paths starting with gcs: point to a bucket in Google Cloud Storage, which must exist. They are in the format gcs:<bucket>(/optionalfolder/subfolder)/filename.sql
# <<blank>> to execute the SQL statements directly against the database. (default: <<blank>>)
# Flyway Teams only
# flyway.dryRunOutput=

# Flyway Teams only
# flyway.oracle.sqlplusWarn=

# When connecting to a Kerberos service to authenticate, the path to the Kerberos config file.
