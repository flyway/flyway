# Comma-separated list of schemas managed by Flyway. These schema names are case-sensitive.
# (default: The default schema for the datasource connection)
# Consequences:
# - The first schema in the list will be automatically set as the default one during the migration.
# - The first schema in the list will also be the one containing the metadata table.
# - The schemas will be cleaned in the order of this list.
# flyway.schemas=

# Name of Flyway's metadata table (default: schema_version)
# By default (single-schema mode) the metadata table is placed in the default schema for the connection provided by the datasource.
# When the flyway.schemas property is set (multi-schema mode), the metadata table is placed in the first schema of the list.
# flyway.table=

# Comma-separated list of locations to scan recursively for migrations. (default: filesystem:<<INSTALL-DIR>>/sql)
# The location type is determined by its prefix.
# Unprefixed locations or locations starting with classpath: point to a package on the classpath and may contain both sql and java-based migrations.
# Locations starting with filesystem: point to a directory on the filesystem and may only contain sql migrations.
# flyway.locations=

# Comma-separated list of fully qualified class names of custom MigrationResolver to use for resolving migrations.
# flyway.resolvers=

# If set to true, default built-in resolvers (jdbc, spring-jdbc and sql) are skipped and only custom resolvers as

# Comma-separated list of directories containing JDBC drivers and Java-based migrations. (default: <INSTALL-DIR>/jars)
# flyway.jarDirs=

# File name prefix for sql migrations (default: V )

# Whether to automatically call clean or not when a validation error occurs. (default: false)
# This is exclusively intended as a convenience for development. Even tough we
# strongly recommend not to change migration scripts once they have been checked into SCM and run, this provides a
# way of dealing with this case in a smooth manner. The database will be wiped clean automatically, ensuring that
# the next migration will bring you back to the state checked into SCM.
# Warning ! Do not enable in production !
# flyway.cleanOnValidationError=

# Whether to disabled clean. (default: false)
# This is especially useful for production environments where running clean can be quite a career limiting move.

# The version to tag an existing schema with when executing baseline. (default: 1)
# flyway.baselineVersion=

# The description to tag an existing schema with when executing baseline. (default: << Flyway Baseline >>)
# flyway.baselineDescription=

# Whether to automatically call baseline when migrate is executed against a non-empty schema with no metadata table.
# This schema will then be initialized with the baselineVersion before executing the migrations.
# Only migrations above baselineVersion will then be applied.
# This is useful for initial Flyway production deployments on projects with an existing DB.
# Be careful when enabling this as it removes the safety net that ensures
# Flyway does not migrate the wrong database in case of a configuration mistake! (default: false)
# flyway.baselineOnMigrate=

# Allows migrations to be run "out of order" (default: false).
# If you already have versions 1 and 3 applied, and now a version 2 is found,
# it will be applied too instead of being ignored.

# This allows you to tie in custom code and logic to the Flyway lifecycle notifications (default: empty).

# (unknown to us) has also been applied. Instead of bombing out (fail fast) with an exception, a
# warning is logged and Flyway continues normally. This is useful for situations where one must be able to deploy
# a newer version of the application even though it doesn't contain migrations included with an older one anymore.
# true to continue normally and log a warning, false to fail fast with an exception.
# flyway.ignoreMissingMigrations=

# Ignore future migrations when reading the metadata table. These are migrations that were performed by a
# newer deployment of the application that are not yet available in this version. For example: we have migrations
# available on the classpath up to version 3.0. The metadata table indicates that a migration to version 4.0
# (unknown to us) has already been applied. Instead of bombing out (fail fast) with an exception, a
# warning is logged and Flyway continues normally. This is useful for situations where one must be able to redeploy
# an older version of the application after the database has been migrated by a newer one.
# true to continue normally and log a warning, false to fail fast with an exception. (default: true)
# flyway.ignoreFutureMigrations=

# Whether to allow mixing transactional and non-transactional statements within the same migration.
