/**
 * Resolves available migrations. This interface can be implemented to create custom resolvers. A custom resolver
 * can be used to create additional types of migrations not covered by the standard resolvers (jdbc, sql, spring-jdbc).
 * Using the {@link org.flywaydb.core.Flyway#setSkipDefaultResolvers(boolean)}, the built-in resolvers can also be
 * completely replaced.
 *
 * <p>If a resolver also implements the {@link org.flywaydb.core.api.configuration.ConfigurationAware} interface,
 * a {@link org.flywaydb.core.api.configuration.FlywayConfiguration} object will automatically be injected before
 * calling {@link #resolveMigrations()}, giving the resolver access to the core flyway configuration, which provides
 * useful data like resolve locations or placeholder configuration.</p>
 *
 * An abstract implementation is provided in {@link BaseMigrationResolver} which handles the storing of the
 * configuration. It is encouraged to subclass that class instead of implementing this interface directly.
