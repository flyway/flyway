/**
 * Interface to be implemented by Java-based Migrations.
 *
 * <p>Java-based migrations are a great fit for all changes that can not easily be expressed using SQL.</p>
 *
 * <p>These would typically be things like</p>
 * <ul>
 *     <li>BLOB &amp; CLOB changes</li>
 *     <li>Advanced bulk data changes (Recalculations, advanced format changes, â€¦)</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Migration classes implementing this interface will be
 * automatically discovered when placed in a location on the classpath.</p>
 *
 * <p>Most users will be better served by subclassing subclass {@link BaseJavaMigration} instead of implementing this
 * interface directly, as {@link BaseJavaMigration} encourages the use of Flyway's default naming convention and
 * comes with sensible default implementations of all methods (except migrate of course) while at the same time also
 * providing better isolation against future additions to this interface.</p>
