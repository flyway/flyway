The test assembly (.cs file) can be compiled against the .Net 2.x framework or greater.
Example on Windows:
C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v2.0.50727\csc.exe /target:library .\FlywayTestAssembly.cs

Once compiled the resulting DLL file must be encoded as a big-endian hexadecimal string and copied into the assembly
SQL migration file. The conversion can be performed using the xxd command:
echo 0x$(xxd -p -u FlywayTestAssembly.dll) | tr -d " "

Alternatively, the assembly create SQL statement can be exported directly from the SQL Server Management Studio
(right-click on the assembly, and "Script Assembly" As -> CREATE to...).
