This fork:

- includes custom `flyway-database-vertica` plugin

To work with the repository you may need to use Java 17. On MacOS you can use sdkman to switch Java:

```
sdk install java 17.0.15-tem
sdk use java 17.0.15-tem
```

To build necessary packages (`flyway-core`, `flyway-database-vertica`, `flyway-mysql` and `flyway-parent`) and publish them to your local Maven repository:

```
./mvnw clean install -DskipTests -pl :flyway-mysql,:flyway-database-vertica,:flyway-core,:flyway-parent
```

If you want to install the package from your local Maven repository in an SBT project add the resolver to build.sbt:

```
resolvers += Resolver.mavenLocal
```

To publish the JAR to Zoined's S3 maven repository create Maven settings file in `~/.m2/settings.xml` with the following content:

```
<settings>
  <servers>
    <server>
      <id>aws-release</id>
      <username>your-access-key</username>
      <password>your-secret-key</password>
    </server>
  </servers>
</settings>
```

You probably already have necessary AWS access and secret keys in `~/.aws/credentials` configured for other projects.

This file is accessed by `maven-s3-wagon` extention that publishes the package to S3.

Then publish the packages (note that `11.0.4-zoined.0` is subject to change):

```
./mvnw deploy:deploy-file -Dfile=pom.xml -DgroupId=org.flywaydb -DartifactId=flyway-parent -Dversion=11.10.4-zoined.0 -Dpackaging=pom -DrepositoryId=aws-release -Durl=s3://maven.zoined.com/releases

./mvnw deploy:deploy-file -Dfile=flyway-core/target/flyway-core-11.10.4-zoined.0.jar -DgroupId=org.flywaydb -DartifactId=flyway-core -Dversion=11.10.4-zoined.0 -Dpackaging=jar -DrepositoryId=aws-release -Durl=s3://maven.zoined.com/releases

./mvnw deploy:deploy-file -Dfile=flyway-database/flyway-database-vertica/target/flyway-database-vertica-11.10.4-zoined.0.jar -DgroupId=org.flywaydb -DartifactId=flyway-database-vertica -Dversion=11.10.4-zoined.0 -Dpackaging=jar -DrepositoryId=aws-release -Durl=s3://maven.zoined.com/releases

./mvnw deploy:deploy-file -Dfile=flyway-database/flyway-mysql/target/flyway-mysql-11.10.4-zoined.0.jar -DgroupId=org.flywaydb -DartifactId=flyway-mysql -Dversion=11.10.4-zoined.0 -Dpackaging=jar -DrepositoryId=aws-release -Durl=s3://maven.zoined.com/releases
```

Note, we did not attempt to build any other packages or run the tests, further changes may be required to do so.
