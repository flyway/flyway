            <li>Flyway includes a custom SQL Fluff plugin, containing extra rules for enterprise users.

        <ul>
            <li>Logic for the undo command has been moved into the separate 'flyway-proprietary' module, which will need to be present on the classpath in order to use the undo command. This also means that undo migrations will now be resolved in Community edition, and migrations may be marked as undone in the info output, though running the undo migrations still requires a Teams or Enterprise license. Lastly, when implementing undo migrations as java migrations, they should extend 'UndoJavaMigration' instead of 'BaseJavaMigration'.</li>

        <p>This release is identical to Flyway 5.0.0. It only adds the platform specific distribution of Flyway Command-line

        <h2 id="5.0.0">Flyway 5.0.0 (2017-12-07)</h2>

        <p><strong>Important note for users upgrading from Flyway 3.x:</strong> This release no longer supports a schema history
            table upgrade from Flyway 3.x. You must upgrade to Flyway 4.2.0 first before upgrading to Flyway 5.0.0.</p>

        <p><strong>Important note for EnterpriseDB, Vertica, SolidDB, Phoenix and Greenplum:</strong>
            Support for these databases has been kept back and will be integrated later in the Flyway 5.0 series.
            You can keep using Flyway 4.2.0 until then.</p>

        <h2>Flyway 4.0 (2016-02-29)</h2>

        <p>This version comes with a <strong>new metadata table format</strong>. Migration is transparent and automatic on
            first
            run of any Flyway command. This new format is not compatible with older Flyway versions.</p>

        <p><strong>Note:</strong> DB 2 z/OS, Vertica, and solidDB users may have to manually upgrade the metadata table or
            drop it and baseline the schema again.</p>

        <h2>Flyway 2.2 (2013-07-15)</h2>

        <h3>New Features</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <a href="https://github.com/flyway/flyway/issues/78" target="_blank">Issue 78</a>
                Gradle Plugin
            </li>

                SQL Azure support
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Incompatible Changes</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Flyway now throws an exception if a placeholder is missing a replacement value</li>
            <li><code>init</code> is now idempotent. Calling <code>init</code> multiple times with the same values no longer
                throws an exception.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Ant:</strong> Dropped support for the separate Spring distribution.<br />Spring is still supported by
                adding the
                Spring jars yourself on Flyway's classpath
            </li>
            <li><strong>Ant:</strong> The distribution is now called <code>flyway-ant-2.2.[zip|tar.gz]</code> (dropped the
                -dist part)
            </li>
            <li><strong>Command-line:</strong> Dropped support for the Spring distribution.<br />Spring is still supported by
                adding the
                Spring jars yourself in the /jars directory
            </li>
            <li><strong>Command-line:</strong> The distribution is now called
                <code>flyway-commandline-2.2.[zip|tar.gz]</code> (dropped the -dist part)
            </li>
            <li><strong>Command-line:</strong> The root directory is now called flyway-2.2 (dropped the -commandline part)
            </li>
            <li><strong>Command-line:</strong> On Linux and OSX the script is now called <code>flyway</code> (dropped the
                .sh)
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Changes</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Flyway is now tested with the Microsoft JDBC Driver 4.0.2206.100 (was 3.0.1301.101)</li>
        </ul>

        <ul>
            <li><a href="http://code.google.com/p/flyway/issues/detail?id=59" target="_blank">Issue 59</a> Spring Dependency
                is now optional.
            </li>
            <li>Core: Flyway now directly depends on commons-logging. This previously happened transitively through the
                spring-jdbc dependency.
            </li>
            <li>Core: Removed deprecated Flyway.get/setTransactionManager() methods. They already had no effect anymore
                since 1.6
            </li>
            <li>Core: Deprecated <a href="/documentation/concepts/migrations#java-based-migrations">JavaMigration</a>. Use
                SpringJdbcMigration instead.
            </li>
            <li>Core: Deprecated JavaMigrationInfoProvider. Use MigrationInfoProvider instead.</li>
            <li>Core: Deprecated JavaMigrationChecksumProvider. Use MigrationChecksumProvider instead.</li>
            <li>Core: Deprecated flyway.baseDir and flyway.basePackage properties. Use the new flyway.locations instead.
            </li>
            <li>Command-line: New download distribution without Spring dependencies</li>
            <li>Ant: New download distribution without Spring dependencies</li>
            <li>Ant: Deprecated direct nesting of placeholder elements. They must now be wrapped inside a placeholders
                container.

            <li><a href="http://code.google.com/p/flyway/issues/detail?id=36" target="_blank">Issue 36</a> Added support for
                specifying a target version up to which Flyway should run migrations.
            </li>
            <li>Added new property <em>ignoreFailedFutureMigration</em> to ignore migration failures that happened while
                deploying a newer version of the software. This allows for software rollbacks without having to do database
                rollbacks, at the cost of weakening fail fast.

            <li><a href="http://code.google.com/p/flyway/issues/detail?id=31" target="_blank">Issue 31</a> Flyway now has its

            </li>
            <li>Removed support for the deprecated <em>metaDataTable</em> property. Use <em>table</em> instead.</li>
            <li>Removed the deprecated <em>Flyway.init(SchemaVersion version)</em> method. Use <em>Flyway.init(SchemaVersion
                version,

        <h2>Flyway 0.9 (2010-08-25)</h2>

        <h3>New Features</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Support for migration checksums (CRC-32 for SQL Migrations, optional custom implementation for Java
                migrations)
            </li>
            <li>Optional accidental change detection running validation (including checksums) before migration</li>
            <li>mvn flyway:validate goal to validate the applied migrations against the available ones in the
                classpath
            </li>
            <li>Sql migrations file names can now have a configurable prefix (Default: V) and suffix (Default: .sql)
            </li>

        <h3>Changes</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>The metadata table format has been extended with new columns (type, checksum, installed_by). Existing
                metadata tables will be upgraded automatically on the first run, no manual intervention is required.
            </li>
            <li>The <em>schemaMetaDataTable</em> property has been renamed to <em>table</em> in both the Flyway class and
                the Maven plugin. The old property still works, but has been deprecated and will be removed in 0.9.5
            </li>
            <li>mvn flyway:migrate now automatically triggers the compile phase to ensure that new migrations are found
                by the plugin
