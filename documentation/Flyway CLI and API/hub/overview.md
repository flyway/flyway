# Automated testing to check your migration scripts before deployment

We believe that automating your testing as part of a CI workflow is a great extension of the current Flyway capabilities, and will enable devs to take even more control of the versioning and automation process for databases.

Flyway Hub is a new, simple to use service that enables Flyway migration script testing in just a few minutes. It is a free service with everything hosted in the cloud by us so you don't need to worry about setting up infrastructure.

## Getting started

All you need to use Flyway Hub is:

- A GitHub account
