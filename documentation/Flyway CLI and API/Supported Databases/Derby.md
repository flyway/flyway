## CLI Usage - installing support
If you want to connect to a Derby database you will first need to download the driver that is compatible with Java 17 from the [Derby download page](https://db.apache.org/derby/derby_downloads.html)
Unpack and place the following files in a location Flyway can find:
* `derby-<verion>.jar`
* `derbyclient-<verion>.jar`
* `derbyshared-<verion>.jar`
* `derbytools-<verion>.jar`

The location needs to be on the [Flyway classpath](<Usage/Adding to the classpath>), we would recommend using the 
[jarDirs](<Configuration/Parameters/Flyway/Jar Dirs>) parameter, if you keep these libraries outside your Flyway installation
then it will make future updates easier.


### Why have we done this ?
There is a [security vulnerability](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-46337) in the Java 17-compatible version of the driver and the fixed version is only available by 
moving onto Java 21 which is not a simple step for Flyway (next major revision territory). 

When we are able to resume packaging 
a vulnerability-free driver then we will do so.

## Java Usage
Derby support is a separate dependency for Flyway and will need to be added to your Java project to access these features.
Derby is found within the `flyway-database-derby` plugin module.
### Maven
#### Redgate
```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.redgate.flyway</groupId>
    <artifactId>flyway-database-derby</artifactId>
</dependency>
```
#### Open Source
```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.flywaydb</groupId>
    <artifactId>flyway-database-derby</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

### Gradle
#### Redgate
```groovy
dependencies {
    implementation "com.redgate.flyway:flyway-database-derby"
}
```
#### Open Source
```groovy
dependencies {
    implementation "org.flywaydb:flyway-database-derby"
}
```

## SQL Script Syntax

- [Standard SQL syntax](Concepts/migrations#sql-based-migrations#syntax) with statement delimiter **;**

### Compatibility
    
- DDL exported by Derby can be used unchanged in a Flyway migration
- Any Derby SQL script executed by Flyway, can be executed by the Derby tools (after the placeholders have been replaced)
- The Derby 10.15 driver requires Java 9+. Flyway users who are constrained to use Java 8 should **not** upgrade to Derby 10.15.

### Example

```sql
/* Single line comment */
CREATE TABLE test_data (
  value VARCHAR(25) NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY
);

/*
Multi-line
comment
*/

-- Sql-style comment

-- Placeholder
INSERT INTO ${tableName} (name) VALUES ('Mr. T');
```

## Limitations

- *None*
