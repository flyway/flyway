## Native Connectors

If you are on the OSS edition, you will have Native Connectors on by default. Otherwise, you may have switched it on.

If you have, you should consult the [MongoDB - Native Connectors](/supported-databases/mongodb/mongodb---native-connectors) documentation instead of this page.

## Terminology
We have to map Flyway concepts and language rooted in the relational database world to MongoDB - this is how Flyway sees the mapping:
  
| MongoDB Concept | Flyway Concept  |
| --------------- | --------------- |
| database        | database/schema |
| collection      | table           |
| row             | document        |
| transaction     | transaction     |

## Using Flyway with MongoDB

### Pre-requisites
- Using Flyway with Maven?
    - Include the latest Flyway MongoDB dependency [here](https://central.sonatype.com/artifact/org.flywaydb/flyway-database-mongodb) in your pom
      - For example:
        - Redgate
          ```xml
          <dependency>
              <groupId>com.redgate.flyway</groupId>
              <artifactId>flyway-database-mongodb</artifactId>
          </dependency>
          ```
         - Open Source
           ```xml
           <dependency>
               <groupId>org.flywaydb</groupId>
               <artifactId>flyway-database-mongodb</artifactId>
           </dependency>
           ```
  - Include the latest MongoDB driver dependency [here](https://github.com/DataGrip/mongo-jdbc-driver) in your buildscript or import into your local maven repository:
    - For example: 
      ```xml
          <dependency>
              <groupId>com.github.kornilova203</groupId>
              <artifactId>mongo-jdbc-driver</artifactId>
              <version>1.19</version>
              <scope>system</scope>
              <systemPath>mongo-jdbc-standalone-1.19.jar</systemPath>  
          </dependency>
      ```
    - or `mvn install:install-file -Dfile=mongo-jdbc-standalone-1.19.jar -DgroupId=com.github.kornilova203 -DartifactId=mongo-jdbc-driver -Dversion=1.19 -Dpackaging=jar -DgeneratePom=true`
	
- Using Flyway with Gradle?
    - Include the latest Flyway MongoDB dependency [here](https://central.sonatype.com/artifact/org.flywaydb/flyway-database-mongodb) as a buildscript dependency
	- Include the latest MongoDB driver dependency [here](https://github.com/DataGrip/mongo-jdbc-driver) in your buildscript
      - For example: 
      ```groovy
        dependencies {
          implementation files('mongo-jdbc-standalone-1.19.jar')
        }
      ```

### Configuring Flyway

You must configure a JDBC URL that points to your database. You can configure a connection using this sample URL as an example:

<code>jdbc:mongodb://<i>ip address</i>:<i>port number</i>/<i>database_name</i></code>

We need to fetch three things to complete this url:

- `ip address`
- `port number` _(optional)_
- `database_name` _(optional)_

### MongoDB Scripts

Migrations in mongo are not `.sql` files like the flyway norm, but instead are `.js`. With standard configuration, flyway will still look for `.sql` files as migrations, but when executing them will expect them to contain `javascript`.

To make this more of a native Mongo experience, we recommend changing the [sqlMigrationSuffixes](/configuration/parameters/flyway/sql-migration-suffixes) configuration to `.js`. This can be done in your TOML configuration as such:

```
[flyway]
sqlMigrationSuffixes = [".js"]
```
### Limitations

- You can't currently do a [Dry-run](<Concepts/Dry Runs>) operation with MongoDB.

### Known issues

- Performance connecting to MongoDB can be slow. This is a known issue in the driver we are using. It should only impact initial connection so will not impact larger or many migrations. We are investigating solutions to this.
- When you see the output of flyway, the migration will be described as type `SQL`. Don't worry, this is just how Flyway describes a versioned migration - your migration hasn't been changed on its way through Flyway !
