## Using Flyway with MongoDB

### Pre-requisites
- Using Flyway with Maven?
    - Include the latest Flyway MongoDB dependency [here](https://central.sonatype.com/artifact/org.flywaydb/flyway-database-mongodb) in your pom
      - For example:
        - Redgate
          ```xml
          <dependency>
              <groupId>com.redgate.flyway</groupId>
              <artifactId>flyway-database-mongodb</artifactId>
          </dependency>
          ```
         - Open Source
           ```xml
           <dependency>
               <groupId>org.flywaydb</groupId>
               <artifactId>flyway-database-mongodb</artifactId>
           </dependency>
           ```
  - Include the latest MongoDB driver dependency [here](https://github.com/DataGrip/mongo-jdbc-driver) in your buildscript or import into your local maven repository:
    - For example: 
      ```xml
          <dependency>
              <groupId>com.github.kornilova203</groupId>
              <artifactId>mongo-jdbc-driver</artifactId>
              <version>1.19</version>
              <scope>system</scope>
              <systemPath>mongo-jdbc-standalone-1.19.jar</systemPath>  
          </dependency>
      ```
    - or `mvn install:install-file -Dfile=mongo-jdbc-standalone-1.19.jar -DgroupId=com.github.kornilova203 -DartifactId=mongo-jdbc-driver -Dversion=1.19 -Dpackaging=jar -DgeneratePom=true`
	
- Using Flyway with Gradle?
    - Include the latest Flyway MongoDB dependency [here](https://central.sonatype.com/artifact/org.flywaydb/flyway-database-mongodb) as a buildscript dependency
	- Include the latest MongoDB driver dependency [here](https://github.com/DataGrip/mongo-jdbc-driver) in your buildscript
      - For example: 
      ```groovy
        dependencies {
          implementation files('mongo-jdbc-standalone-1.19.jar')
        }
      ```

### Configuring Flyway

You must configure a JDBC URL that points to your database. You can configure a connection using this sample URL as an example:

<code>jdbc:mongodb://<i>ip address</i>:<i>port number</i>/<i>database_name</i></code>

We need to fetch three things to complete this url:

- `ip address`
- `port number` _(optional)_
- `database_name` _(optional)_

### MongoDB Scripts

Migrations in mongo are not `.sql` files like the flyway norm, but instead are `.js`. With standard configuration, flyway will still look for `.sql` files as migrations, but when executing them will expect them to contain `javascript`.

To make this more of a native Mongo experience, we recommend changing the [sqlMigrationSuffixes](/configuration/parameters/flyway/sql-migration-suffixes) configuration to `.js`. This can be done in your TOML configuration as such:

```
[flyway]
sqlMigrationSuffixes = [".js"]
```

### Known issues

- Performance connecting to MongoDB can be slow. This is a known issue in the driver we are using. It should only impact initial connection so will not impact larger or many migrations. We are investigating solutions to this.
- When you see the output of flyway, the migration will be described as type `SQL`. Don't worry, this is just how Flyway describes a versioned migration - your migration hasn't been changed on its way through Flyway !
