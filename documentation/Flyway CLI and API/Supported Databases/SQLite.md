## SQL Script Syntax

- [Standard SQL syntax](Concepts/migrations#sql-based-migrations#syntax) with statement delimiter **;**
- Triggers with `BEGIN ... END;` block

### Compatibility

- DDL exported by SQLite can be used unchanged in a Flyway migration
- Any SQLite SQL script executed by Flyway, can be executed by the SQLite tools (after the placeholders have been replaced)

### Example

<pre class="prettyprint">/* Single line comment */
CREATE TABLE test_data (
  value VARCHAR(25) NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY
);

/*
Multi-line
comment
*/

-- Sql-style comment

-- Placeholder
INSERT INTO ${tableName} (name) VALUES ('Mr. T');

CREATE TRIGGER update_customer_address UPDATE OF address ON customers
  BEGIN
    UPDATE orders SET address = new.address WHERE customer_name = old.name;
  END;</pre>

## Limitations

- No concurrent migration as SQLite does not support `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE` locking
- No support for multiple schemas or changing the current schema, as SQLite doesn't support schemas
- No support for `CREATE TRANSACTION` and `COMMIT` statements within a migration, as SQLite doesn't support nested transactions
