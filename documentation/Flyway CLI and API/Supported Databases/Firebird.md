## Java Usage
Firebird support is a separate dependency for Flyway and will need to be added to your Java project to access these features.

### Maven
#### Redgate
```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.redgate.flyway</groupId>
    <artifactId>flyway-firebird</artifactId>
</dependency>
```
#### Open Source
```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.flywaydb</groupId>
    <artifactId>flyway-firebird</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

### Gradle
#### Redgate
```groovy
dependencies {
    implementation "com.redgate.flyway:flyway-firebird"
}
```
#### Open Source
```groovy
dependencies {
    implementation "org.flywaydb:flyway-firebird"
}
```

## SQL Script Syntax

 - [Standard SQL syntax](Concepts/migrations#syntax)
- Terminator changes supported using `SET TERM <i>&lt;new terminator&gt;</i><i>&lt;old terminator&gt;</i>
- Firebird dialect 3 only

### Compatibility
    
- DDL exported by Firebird isql needs to be split into separate files on each `COMMIT WORK`, removing the `COMMIT WORK` statement from the script.
- Any Firebird SQL script executed by Flyway, can be executed by the Firebird tools (after the placeholders have been replaced).

### Example
 
 ```sql
/* Single line comment */
CREATE TABLE test_data (
  value VARCHAR(25) NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY
);
 /*
Multi-line
comment
*/
 -- Sql-style comment
 -- Placeholder
ALTER TABLE ${tableName} ADD id INT NOT NULL;
 -- Terminator changes
SET TERM #;
CREATE OR ALTER PROCEDURE SHIP_ORDER (
    PO_NUM CHAR(8))
AS
BEGIN
  /* Stored procedure body */
END#
SET TERM ;#
```

## Limitations

- Mixing DDL and DML involving the same tables in a single migration is not supported. Firebird disallows DDL changes to 
be used by DML in the same transaction, so one of the following is necessary:
  - separate migrations for DML / DDL, or
  - a [per-script override](https://documentation.red-gate.com/flyway/flyway-cli-and-api/configuration/script-configuration) of <code>executeInTransaction</code>

- `SET TRANSACTION` and `COMMIT [WORK]` are not supported in migrations. `COMMIT RETAIN` can be used, but this will only 
allow partial rollback of a migration; only statements after the last `COMMIT RETAIN` can be rolled back.
- Migrations modifying or dropping objects while the database is in use can result in long delays or "object X is in use" 
errors as Firebird uses existence locks on metadata objects when they are in use. It may be necessary to shut down the 
database and run the migration with exclusive access.
