Shows the details and status information about all the migrations that Flyway knows about.
Info lets you know where you stand. At a glance you will see which migrations have already been applied, which other ones are still pending, when they were executed and whether they were successful or not.

You might want this to:

* Check the current migration state of your target DB
* Understand what is yet to be deployed in a more digestible format than the raw filenames
