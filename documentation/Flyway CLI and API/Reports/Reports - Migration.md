 Database migration is the core of what Flyway does, it takes a set of sequenced changes (migrations), applies them to your database and keeps track of what happened and when.

 You might want this to:
 
 * Have a record of what happened when for audit or reporting purposes
 * Understand and be able to communicate failures in a more richly descriptive manner
