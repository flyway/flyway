Flyway Dry Run lets you preview the SQL that Flyway would execute on your DB based on the migration state of the DB, the pending migrations and the way you have configured Flyway.

You might want this to:

* preview the changes Flyway will make to the database
* submit the SQL statements for review to a DBA before applying them
* use Flyway to determine what needs updating, yet use a different tool to apply the actual database changes
