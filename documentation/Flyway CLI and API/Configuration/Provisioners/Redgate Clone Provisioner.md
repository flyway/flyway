# Redgate Clone Provisioner - Preview
This [provisioner](Configuration/Provisioners) allows for the provisioning and re-provisioning of databases using [Redgate Clone](https://www.red-gate.com/products/redgate-clone/?_ga=2.146246964.1042910986.1704804078-728513631.1704372124).

Common use cases of the Redgate Clone provisioner are:
* Restoring a development database from a clone or snapshot of production
* Spinning up a development database with appropriate state on a git branch switch
* Avoiding the use of a baseline migration script when testing the deployment of migrations or automatically generating new migrations

Prerequisites:
* A Redgate Clone server needs to be set up
* The image to use for generating the clone needs to already exist on the clone server
* For the use case of replacing the baseline migration script, the image must contain a [flyway schema history table](Configuration/Parameters/Flyway/Table), so it is recommended to run [baseline](Commands/Baseline) on your target database before capturing the image

To configure this provisioner:
1. Set the value of the [provisioner parameter](Configuration/Parameters/Environments/Provisioner) to `clone`
2. Set the value of the [environment JDBC URL parameter](Configuration/Parameters/Environments/URL) to `${clone.url}`. This will derive the JDBC URL from Redgate Clone.
   * Note that currently for SQL Server the database name needs to be set explicitly after this within the URL parameter as shown in the example below (the JDBC URL returned by Redgate Clone always ends with a `;` so additional properties can be appended)
   * For other database flavours it is only possible to connect to the database exposed as the default database on the image
3. Populate the following resolver properties:
   - `url` - (Required)  The Redgate Clone server URL
   - `dataImage` - (Required) The data image to use for creating the container
   - `dataContainer` - (Required) The data container to use for the database clone - this needs to be unique
   - `dataContainerLifetime` - (Required) The lifetime of the data container. This takes the form of a number optionally followed by a time unit, `s`, `m`, `h`, or `d`. If no time unit is specified, seconds are assumed. `0` can be used to set the lifetime to be unlimited.
   - `authenticationToken` - (Required) The token required for authenticating with the Redgate Clone Server. It is recommended to store this as a secret and resolve it using an appropriate [property resolver](Configuration/Property Resolvers).
   - `operationTimeout` - (Optional) The amount of time to wait for Redgate Clone operations to complete. This takes the form of a number optionally followed by a time unit, `s`, `m`, `h`, or `d`. If no time unit is specified, seconds are assumed. The default value is `5m`.

## Example
This can be used in the TOML configuration like this:
```toml
[environments.development]
url = "${clone.url}databaseName=my-database"
provisioner = "clone"

[environments.development.resolvers.clone]
url = "https://clone.red-gate.com:1234/cloning-api"
dataImage = "mssql-empty"
dataContainer = "MyContainer"
dataContainerLifetime = "1h"
authenticationToken = "${localSecret.RedgateCloneToken}"
```

If you want to manage the lifetime of the data containers, it is also possible to not set the `provisioner` parameter, and just use this [as a property resolver](Configuration/Property Resolvers/Redgate Clone Resolver).
