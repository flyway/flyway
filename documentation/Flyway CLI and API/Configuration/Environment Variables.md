# Environment Variables

The Flyway [command-line tool](Usage/Command Line), [Maven plugin](Usage/Maven Goal) and
[Gradle plugin](usage/Gradle Task) support loading configuration via environment variables.
This also possible using the Flyway API by calling the `envVars()` method on the configuration.

See [configuration](Configuration/parameters) for a full list of supported configuration parameters.
