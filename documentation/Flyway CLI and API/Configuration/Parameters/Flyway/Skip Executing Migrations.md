# Skip Executing Migrations

## Description
Whether Flyway should skip migration execution. The remainder of the operation will run as normal - including updating the schema history table, callbacks, etc.

`skipExecutingMigrations` essentially allows you to mimic a migration being executed, because the schema history table is still updated as normal.

`skipExecutingMigrations` can be used to bring an out-of-process change into Flyway's change control process. For instance, a script run against the database outside of Flyway (like a hotfix) can be turned into a migration. The hotfix migration can be deployed with Flyway with `skipExecutingMigrations=true`. The schema history table will be updated with the new migration, but the script itself won't be executed again.

`skipExecutingMigrations` can be used with [cherryPick](Configuration/Parameters/Flyway/Cherry Pick) to skip specific migrations.

## Default
