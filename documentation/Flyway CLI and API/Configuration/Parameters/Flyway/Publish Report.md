# Publish Report

## Description

A boolean value that tells Flyway whether or not to publish to Flyway Pipelines the Flyway report generated by this run. Set to false by default. See the Flyway Pipelines documentation [here](https://red-gate.com/flyway/pipelines/documentation).

In order to publish a report the report must be generated (see [reportEnabled](configuration/Parameters/Flyway/Report Enabled)), and the CLI must be publishing to the service (see [publishResult](configuration/Parameters/Flyway/Publish Result)).

**Note:** Flyway Pipelines is currently in preview.
