# Encoding

## Description
The encoding of SQL migrations.

The encodings that Flyway supports are:

- `US-ASCII`
- `ISO-8859-1`
- `UTF-8`
- `UTF-16BE`
- `UTF-16LE`
- `UTF-16`

We recommend using a consistent file encoding across all of your scripts to minimize the issues you encounter. 
See the Troubleshooting section below for known problems and solutions.

## Default
UTF-8

## Usage

### Commandline
```powershell
./flyway -encoding="UTF-16" info
```

### TOML Configuration File
```toml
[flyway]
encoding = "UTF-16"
```

### Configuration File
```properties
flyway.encoding=UTF-16
```

### Environment Variable
```properties
FLYWAY_ENCODING=UTF-16
```

### API
```java
Flyway.configure()
    .encoding("UTF-16")
    .load()
```

### Gradle
```groovy
flyway {
    encoding = 'UTF-16'
}
```

### Maven
```xml
<configuration>
    <encoding>UTF-16</encoding>
</configuration>
```

## Troubleshooting

### My text editor doesn't support any of Flyway's supported encodings

This is because some encoding names are synonyms for others. For instance, an editor which specifies `ANSI` is actually `ISO-8859-1`.

### I'm getting a MalformedInputException

This exception is due to inconsistent encoding configurations. `ISO-8859-1` is the most compatible supported encoding, so using this encoding could fix your configuration. However, we recommend that all of your scripts have the same encoding.
