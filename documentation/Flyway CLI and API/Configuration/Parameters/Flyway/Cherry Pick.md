# Cherry Pick
{% include teams.html %}

## Description
A Comma separated list of migrations that Flyway should consider when migrating, undoing, or repairing. Migrations are considered in the order that they are supplied, overriding the default ordering. Leave blank to consider all discovered migrations.<br/>
Note that when used in conjunction with `undo`, the migrations are undone in reverse to how they are specified to `cherryPick` i.e. `flyway undo -cherryPick=3,2,1` will undo migrations in the order `1,2,3`.

Each item in the list must either be a valid migration version (e.g `2.1`) or a valid migration description (e.g. `create_table`).

For example:
- Create migrations `V1__create_table1.sql`, `V2__create_table2.sql`, and `R__create_view.sql`
- Run `flyway migrate -cherryPick="1,create_view"`

The schema history table now shows migration `V1` and `create_view` as being successfully applied. However `V2` has been skipped and is marked as 'ignored'. `V2__create_table2.sql` can be cherry picked for deployment at a later time.

## Usage

### Commandline
```powershell
./flyway -cherryPick="2.0" migrate
```

### TOML Configuration File
```toml
[flyway]
cherryPick = ["2.0"]
```

### Configuration File
```properties
flyway.cherryPick=2.0
```

### Environment Variable
```properties
FLYWAY_CHERRY_PICK=2.0
```

### API
```java
CherryPickConfigurationExtension cherryPickConfigurationExtension = configuration.getPluginRegister().getPlugin(CherryPickConfigurationExtension.class);
cherryPickConfigurationExtension.setCherryPick(List.of("2.0"));
```

### Gradle
```groovy
flyway {
    pluginConfiguration = [
            cherryPick: '2.0'
    ]
}
```

### Maven
```xml
<configuration>
    <pluginConfiguration>
        <cherryPick>2.0</cherryPick>
    </pluginConfiguration>
</configuration>
```

## Use Cases

### Deferred migration execution

Let's say you have a project with 3 migrations:

```
V1__fastCreate1.sql
V2__slowInsert2.sql
V3__fastCreate3.sql
```

Migration `V2` takes a tremendously large amount of time to execute so you decide executing it overnight would be better, but still need to execute migrations `V1` and `V3`. Without `cherryPick` this would involve deleting `V2` from disk and adding it back when needed which is a tedious and error prone task. Using `cherryPick` we can simply migrate `V1` and `V3` immediately:

```
flyway migrate -cherryPick="1,3"
```

When it comes to migrating `V2`, we can utilise [outOfOrder](Configuration/Parameters/Flyway/Out Of Order) as follows:

```
flyway migrate -outOfOrder="true"
```

### Undo out of order

By default `undo` will undo migrations starting with the latest applied migration. With `cherryPick` you can undo migrations out of order, targeting specific migrations to undo.

Let's assume the following 3 migrations are applied, and all have an available [undo migration](Concepts/migrations#undo-migrations):

```
V1__first.sql
V2__second.sql
V3__third.sql
```

If we only want to undo migration `V2` we can run:

```
flyway undo -cherryPick="2"
```

This will let us target any migration to undo out of order.
