# Check: Major Rules

## Description
You can configure your pipeline to fail when specified static code analysis rules beyond a given tolerance level are violated.

`majorRules` should contain a comma-separated list of [rules](Usage/Code Analysis Rules) which are considered to be major.

If the total number of `majorRules` violations exceeds the [majorTolerance](Configuration/Parameters/Flyway/Check/Major Tolerance), Flyway will fail.

## Default

No rules are regarded as major violations
