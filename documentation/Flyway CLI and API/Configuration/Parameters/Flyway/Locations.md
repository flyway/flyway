# Locations

## Description
Comma-separated list of locations to scan recursively for migrations. The location type is determined by its prefix.

For commandline usage, we recommend storing migrations in a separate folder to your Flyway installation.
This makes upgrading easier, as the whole installation folder can be deleted and overwritten without affecting migrations.

### Classpath
Unprefixed locations or locations starting with <code>classpath:</code> point to a package on the classpath and may contain both SQL and Java-based migrations. You must ensure the package is available on the classpath (see [Adding to the classpath](<Usage/Adding to the classpath>)).

### Filesystem
Locations starting with <code>filesystem:</code> point to a directory on the filesystem, may only contain SQL migrations and are only scanned recursively down non-hidden directories.

### Amazon S3
Locations starting with <code>s3:</code> point to a bucket in AWS S3, may only contain SQL migrations, and are scanned recursively. They are in the format <code>s3:&lt;bucket&gt;(/optionalfolder/subfolder)</code>. To use AWS S3, the [AWS SDK v2](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/software.amazon.awssdk/services) and dependencies must be included, and [configured](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-java/v1/developer-guide/credentials.html) for your S3 account.<br/>

### Google Cloud Storage
{% include teams.html %}

Locations starting with <code>gcs:</code> point to a bucket in Google Cloud Storage, may only contain SQL migrations, and are scanned recursively. They are in the format <code>gcs:&lt;bucket&gt;(/optionalfolder/subfolder)</code>. To use GCS, the GCS library must be included, and the GCS environment variable <code>GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS</code> must be set to the credentials file for the service account that has access to the bucket.<br/>

### Wildcards
Locations can contain wildcards. This allows matching against a path pattern instead of a single path. Supported wildcards:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        <code>**</code> : Matches any 0 or more directories. (e.g. <code>db/**/test</code> will match <code>db/version1.0/test</code>, <code>db/version2.0/test</code>, <code>db/development/version/1.0/test</code> but not <code>db/version1.0/release</code>)
    </li>
    <li>
        <code>*</code> : Matches any 0 or more non-separator characters. (e.g. <code>db/release1.*</code> will match <code>db/release1.0</code>, <code>db/release1.1</code>, <code>db/release1.123</code> but not <code>db/release2.0</code>)
    </li>
    <li>
        <code>?</code> : Matches any 1 non-separator character. (e.g. <code>db/release1.?</code> will match <code>db/release1.0</code>, <code>db/release1.1</code> but not <code>db/release1.11</code>)
    </li>
</ul>

## Default

**API:**

classpath:db/migration

**Maven/Gradle:**
filesystem:src/main/resources/db/migration

**Commandline:**

filesystem:sql

*Note: We do not recommend relying on the commandline default value. It may be changed in a future release.*

## Usage

### Commandline
```powershell
./flyway -locations="filesystem:./sql" info
```

### TOML Configuration File
```toml
[flyway]
locations = ["filesystem:./sql"]
```

### Configuration File
```properties
flyway.locations=filesystem:./sql
```

### Environment Variable
```properties
FLYWAY_LOCATIONS=filesystem:./sql
```

### API
```java
Flyway.configure()
    .locations("filesystem:./sql")
    .load()
```

### Gradle
```groovy
flyway {
    locations = ['filesystem:./sql']
}
```

### Maven
```xml
<configuration>
    <locations>
        <location>filesystem:./sql</location>
    </locations>
</configuration>
```
