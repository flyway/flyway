# Community Plugins and Integrations

Flyway comes out of the box with integrations for [Maven](Usage/Maven Goal), [Gradle](usage/Gradle Task)
and [Docker](Usage/Command Line).

The broader Flyway community however maintains a much larger collection of integrations and plugins. The tools and
platforms being integrated with include application frameworks, CI servers, deployment automation platforms, build tools
and much more.
