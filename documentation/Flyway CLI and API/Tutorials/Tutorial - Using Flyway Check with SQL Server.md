# Tutorial: Using Flyway Check with SQL Server

{% include enterprise.html %}

## Introduction

The new `check` command is run prior to migrating, to give you confidence by producing a report which allows you to better understand the consequences of your planned migrations.

One or more of the following flags must be set, which determine what the report contains:

 - `-changes` produces a report of all the changes that will be applied to the schema in the next migration.
 - `-drift` produces a report showing objects in the schema which are not the result of any of the currently applied migrations, i.e. changes made outside of Flyway.

More information can be found on [the check command page](Commands/check-command).

This tutorial exemplifies the scenario where you have access to both your target DB (`url`) and a build DB (`buildUrl`).

## Download the latest version of Flyway Enterprise CLI

First, [download the latest version of the Flyway Enterprise CLI](Usage/Command-line) and extract its contents.

## Setting up databases

To use `check` we will need access to two databases:

- The **target** database. This is the database we're interested in making changes to.
- A **build** database. Flyway will clean this database, apply migrations to it, and make comparisons in order to generate **change and drift reports**.

In this example, there are two databases in our SQL Server instance: `foobar` (the target) and `check_build_db`. Both can be accessed by the `sa` user.

## Configuration

As well as the usual config parameters (`flyway.url`, `flyway.user`, `flyway.password`, `flyway.licenseKey`...), we also need to configure properties specific to the `check` command (see [the documentation](Commands/check-command) for more details). In this case, we only need to configure `flyway.check.buildUrl` and `flyway.reportFilename` as the other properties all have suitable default values.

Our `flyway.conf` file (found in the `conf` folder), should contain the following values:

```
flyway.url=jdbc:sqlserver://localhost;databaseName=foobar;trustServerCertificate=true
flyway.user=sa
flyway.password=Flyway123
flyway.licenseKey=<put your license key here>

flyway.check.buildUrl=jdbc:sqlserver://localhost;databaseName=check_build_db;trustServerCertificate=true
flyway.reportFilename=check_report
```

## Setting up migrations

In the `sql` folder, we can create a new file `V1__add_table.sql`, containing a simple schema change:

```sql
create table PERSON (
    ID int not null,
    NAME varchar(100) not null
);
```
## Detecting changes using `-changes` flag

Before we run `migrate`, we can use `check` to generate a change report by running it with the `-changes` flag:

<pre class="console">./flyway check -changes</pre>

## Viewing the report output

Having run the command, we can see that Flyway has generated HTML and JSON versions of the `check` report in the working directory. Opening `check_report.html` in a browser, we can clearly see what objects will change in our target schema as a result of running our pending migrations, expressed in the form of SQL queries. The JSON report contains the same information but in a more machine-readable format.

## Applying the changes

We now know that applying our pending migrations will have the intended effect on our target schema, so we can go ahead and apply them using `migrate`:

<pre class="console">./flyway migrate</pre>

## Detecting drift using `-drift` flag

Before applying future migrations, we might also want to confirm that no drift has occurred in the target database, i.e. all schema changes have been applied in the form of flyway migrations, as oppose to unrecorded manual changes.

To demonstrate this, we can apply a manual change to the target database, e.g. using SSMS:

```sql
use foobar;

alter table PERSON add EMAIL varchar(100);
```

We can then run `check` with the `-drift` flag:

<pre class="console">./flyway check -drift</pre>

This creates another pair of HTML and JSON reports. This time the files contain a drift report, showing how the target database schema (in this case `foobar`) differs from whats contained in the applied migrations.

## Using Check in Docker

This feature can also be accessed through the Flyway Enterprise Docker images.

### Pulling the images

First pull the relevant images for this tutorial:

<pre class="console">docker pull mcr.microsoft.com/mssql/server</pre>
<pre class="console">docker pull redgate/flyway</pre>

### Running SQL Server

We can then use Docker to set up an instance of SQL Server with a login user `sa` and password `Flyway123`:

<pre class="console">docker run -e "ACCEPT_EULA=Y" -e "SA_PASSWORD=Flyway123" -p 1433:1433 -d mcr.microsoft.com/mssql/server</pre>

*Make sure there are no other SQL Server instances running with the same port*

As before, create a target database `foobar` and a build database `check_build_db` e.g. using SSMS.

### Preparing the local working directory

Folders in the local directory can later be mounted to the Flyway Docker image.

Create a folder called `sql` to contain migrations and add a new SQL migration `V1__add_table.sql`:

```sql
create table PERSON (
    ID int not null,
    NAME varchar(100) not null
);
```

Along with `sql`, you might also want to create a `reports` folder to store the reports that will be produced, and a `conf` folder to store the configuration file.

Inside `conf`, place a file called `flyway.conf` and add the following contents:

```
flyway.url=jdbc:sqlserver://localhost;databaseName=foobar;trustServerCertificate=true
flyway.user=sa
flyway.password=Flyway123
flyway.licenseKey=<put your license key here>

flyway.check.buildUrl=jdbc:sqlserver://localhost;databaseName=check_build_db;trustServerCertificate=true
flyway.reportFilename=reports/check_report
```

### Running `check` in Docker

Run the `check -changes` Flyway Docker image:

<pre class="console">docker run --rm --network="host" -v $PWD/sql:/flyway/sql -v $PWD/reports:/flyway/reports -v $PWD/conf:/flyway/conf redgate/flyway check -changes</pre>

Here, we have mounted the relevant volumes from the working directory and used a network where Flyway can access the SQL Server container.

This will generate a report showing the changes which will be made to the database on the next `migrate`. The HTML and JSON forms of the report can be found in the local `reports` folder.

Similarly, we could replace `-changes` with `-drift` to instead see how the target schema is different from what's defined in the migrations, or use both `-changes` and `-drift` to have both in the same report.

### Using Docker Compose

We could also set up a similar environment using `docker compose`:

```yml
version: '3'
services:
  flyway:
    image: redgate/flyway
    command: -url=jdbc:sqlserver://db;trustServerCertificate=true -check.buildUrl=jdbc:sqlserver://db;databaseName=check_build_db;trustServerCertificate=true -password=Flyway123 -user=sa -reportFilename=reports/check_report check -changes
    environment:
      - FLYWAY_LICENSE_KEY=<put your license key here>
    volumes:
      - ./sql:/flyway/sql
      - ./reports:/flyway/reports
    depends_on:
      - db


  db:
    image: mcr.microsoft.com/mssql/server
    environment:
      - ACCEPT_EULA=Y
      - MSSQL_SA_PASSWORD=Flyway123
    ports:
      - 1433:1433
```
In this case, Flyway is using the default SQL Server databases and is being configured using command-line flags rather than mounting the `conf` volume.

## Summary

This tutorial outlined the following concepts:

- How `check` can be used to generate pre-migration reports.
- Configuring `check` and applying it to SQL Server.
- Using `check` in Docker.
