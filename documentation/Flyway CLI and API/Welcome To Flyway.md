title: Welcome To Flyway Engine
---

Flyway Engine is an database migration tool that strongly favors simplicity and convention over configuration.

It is based around just several core commands:
[Migrate](Commands/migrate), [Clean](Commands/clean), [Info](Commands/info), [Validate](Commands/validate), [Undo](Commands/undo), [Baseline](Commands/baseline) and [Repair](Commands/repair).

Plus an extended set of commands for more advanced use-cases:
[Auth](Commands/Auth), [Check](<Commands/Check command>) and [Snapshot](Commands/Snapshot)

Migrations can be written in:
- [SQL](Concepts/migrations#sql-based-migrations) - database-specific syntax (such as PL/SQL, T-SQL, \...) is supported
- [Java](Concepts/migrations#java-based-migrations) - for advanced data transformations or dealing with LOBs.

It has a [Command-line client](<Usage/Command Line>).
It also allows [Java API](Usage/api-java) integration for migrating the database on your application startup.
Alternatively, you can also use the [Maven plugin](<Usage/Maven Goal>) or [Gradle plugin](<Usage/Gradle Task>).

And if that's not enough, there are [plugins](Usage/Community%20Plugins%20and%20Integrations) available for
Spring Boot, Dropwizard, Grails, Play, SBT, Ant, Griffon, Grunt, Ninja and more!
