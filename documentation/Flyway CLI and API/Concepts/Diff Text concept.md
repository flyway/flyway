# Diff Text

{% include enterprise.html %}

This concept page assumes you understand the following area of Flyway:
 - [Diff](<Concepts/Diff concept>)

If you have not done so, please review this page first.

## Why is this useful ?
The `diffText` commands prints out the object level differences from the differences generated by `diff`.

## How is this used ?
To perform `diffText` a `diff` operation must first be performed. You may either configure the toml or use the command line as shown below.

CLI configuration:
```
flyway diffText -diffText.changes="id1,id2"
```

Toml configuration:
```
[flyway.diffText]
changes = ["id1","id2"]
```

You may specify `-` as the set of change ids to read changes from standard in. If you do not provide any change ids then the differences for all changes are printed.

### Note
- If the diff artifact provided is altered by any means which would result in the commandline being unable to read the artifact, then the `diffText` command will fail.
- The location of the diff artifact can be changed using the `diff.artifactFilename` and `diffText.artifactFilename` options.

## Further Reading
See [here](<Usage/Command-line/Command-line - diffText>) for more information on how to use the `diffText` command.
