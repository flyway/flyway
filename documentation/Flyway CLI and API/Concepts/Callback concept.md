# Callbacks

While migrations are sufficient for most needs, there are certain situations that require you to <strong>execute the same action
over and over again</strong>. This could be recompiling procedures, updating materialized views and many other types of housekeeping.

For this reason, Flyway offers you the possibility to **hook into its lifecycle** by using Callbacks.
In order to use these callbacks, name a script after the callback name (ie. afterMigrate.sql) and drop it alongside your other scripts in your migrations folder. Flyway will then invoke it when the execution event criteria listed below is met.

_Note: Callbacks are [not supported by Native Connectors](https://documentation.red-gate.com/display/FD/Flyway+Native+Connectors+-+MongoDB)._

These are the events Flyway supports:

Callbacks can be implemented either in SQL or in Java.

## Location
Flyway will discover SQL callbacks in the same manner as SQL migration scripts, based on the [locations](Configuration/parameters/flyway/locations) defined.

Whereas Java callbacks will be picked up from the classpath.

## SQL Callbacks

The most convenient way to hook into Flyway's lifecycle is through SQL callbacks. These are simply sql files
in the configured locations following a certain naming convention: the event name followed by the SQL migration suffix.

Placeholder replacement works just like it does for <a href="Concepts/migrations#sql-based-migrations">SQL migrations</a>.

Optionally the callback may also include a description. In that case the callback name is composed of the event name,
the separator, the description and the suffix. Example: `beforeRepair__vacuum.sql`.

**Note:** Flyway will also honor any `sqlMigrationSuffixes` you have configured, when scanning for SQL callbacks.

## Java Callbacks

If SQL Callbacks aren't flexible enough for you, you have the option to implement the
[**Callback**](https://javadoc.io/doc/org.flywaydb/flyway-core/latest/org/flywaydb/core/api/callback/Callback.html)
interface yourself. You can even hook multiple Callback implementations in the lifecycle. Java callbacks have the
additional flexibility that a single Callback implementation can handle multiple lifecycle events, and are
therefore not bound by the SQL callback naming convention.

**More info:** [Java-based Callbacks](usage/API (Java)/API - hooks#callsbacks)

## Script Callbacks

Much like SQL callbacks, Flyway also supports the execution of callbacks written in a scripting language. The supported file extensions are the same as those supported by [script migrations](concepts/migrations#Migrations-Scriptmigrations). For example, you could have a `beforeRepair__vacuum.ps1` callback. Script callbacks give you much more flexibility and power during the migration lifecycle. Some of the things you can achieve are:

- Executing external tools between migrations
- Creating or cleaning local files for migrations to use

## Callback ordering

When multiple callbacks for the same event are found, they are executed in the alphanumerical order. 
E.G.
```sql
beforeConnect__1.sql
beforeConnect__2.sql
beforeConnect__a.sql
beforeConnect__b.sql
```
