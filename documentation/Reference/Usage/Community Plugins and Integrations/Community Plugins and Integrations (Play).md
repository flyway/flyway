Play doesn't come with out-of-the-box support for Flyway, however Toshiyuki Takahashi has created a Play plugin to substitute Evolutions for Flyway.

This lets you run your Flyway migrations on Play application startup.

For <strong>Play 2.1, 2.2 and 2.3</strong> you can use the <a href="https://github.com/tototoshi/play-flyway">play-flyway plugin</a>.

For <strong>Play 2.4 and newer</strong> you can use the <a href="https://github.com/flyway/flyway-play">flyway-play module</a>.

Both sites contain instructions on how to get started quickly as well as comprehensive documentation on usage and configuration.
