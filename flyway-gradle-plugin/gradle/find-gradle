# PURPOSE
#
# The Gradle wrapper[1] is a simple and convenient way of making Gradle
# builds self-contained and reproducible. However, in multi-project
# builds, it can be cumbersome to type in relative paths e.g.:
#   ./gradlew   # when in root
#   ../gradlew  # when in subdir
#
# This script finds any Gradle wrapper (gradlew) executable in the
# current directory or any directory above it. If none can be found,
# it will fall back to the system-wide installation at $SYSTEM_GRADLE.
#
#
# INSTALLATION
#
# 1. Remove GRADLE_HOME/bin from your PATH if it's already present.
#
#    $ which gradle # should return empty when finished
#
# 2. Symlink find-gradle somewhere on your path as 'gradle', e.g.:
#
#    $ ln -s $PWD/find-gradle /usr/local/bin/gradle
#
#
# USAGE
#
# Use exactly like you would a normal Gradle executable. All arguments
# supplied are `exec`d against the gradle(w) executable once found.
#
#     $ gradle [options]
#
#
# DEBUGGING
#
# To observe the search for gradlew and to ensure which one is
# ultimately used, invoke the script with Bash's "-x" option. Below you
# can see the directory traversal at work, finally selecting the
# 'gradlew' script one directory up from where 'gradle' was invoked.
#
#     $ cd /Work/spring-framework/spring-context
#     $ bash -x $(which gradle) --version
#     + GRADLEW=/Work/spring-framework/spring-context/gradlew
#     + GRADLEW=/Work/spring-framework/gradlew
#     + /Work/spring-framework/gradlew --version

# BUGS
#
# It doesn't look for 'gradlew' in the root directory. Why would you
# want it to? Improvements welcome at http://github.com/cbeams/shell-scripts.
